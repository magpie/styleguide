== Naming:

* Use snake_case for methods.

* Use CamelCase for classes and modules. Keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, 
  XML uppercase.

* Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for other constants.

== Formatting:

* Use ASCII (or UTF-8, if you have to).

* Use 2 space indent, no tabs.

* Use Unix-style line endings.

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons,
  around { and before }.

* No spaces after (, [ and before ], ).

* Indent when as deep as case.

* Keep lines fewer than 80 characters.

== Syntax:

* Use def with parentheses when there are arguments.

* Use the each method on an object instead of 'for each'

* Never use then.

* Use &&/|| instead of and/or

* Avoid multiline ?:, use if.

* Use parentheses when calling methods if there are arguments

* Avoid return where not required.

* Prefer map over collect, find over detect, find_all over select.
